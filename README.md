README

This is a quick tutorial about how to use this website/list.
First, you’ll click on the button „Add movie to your list“
Then, a window pops up, which you can close by selecting the button with the „x“ icon. You can enter your title, a production date, a country, and a genre. Hit the „plus“ button to add the values you have entered to your list. 
Click on a film to edit or delete it by hitting the trashcan symbol. 
Don’t worry; your film list automatically saves after submitting a new film!

Hopefully, you enjoy it. 
If you have questions DM me on GitHub, please!

Cheers!
